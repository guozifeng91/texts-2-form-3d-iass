# About the tower dataset
The dataset consists two CSV files that store the topology of the CEM graph ([topology.csv](cem-dataset/cem-towers/topology.csv)) and the metric properties of each generated forms ([data.csv](cem-dataset/cem-towers/data.csv.gz)).
A reader script ([SDML_CEM.py](cem-dataset/cem-towers/SDML_CEM.py)) has been provided for easy access to the dataset.
