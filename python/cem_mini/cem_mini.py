cem_mini is a python replica of the CEM method developed by Ohlbrock, P. O. ETH Zurich
cem_mini aims to minimize the dependent libraries and attemps to stay with function oriented programming style
cem_mini is validated by comparing with the compas_cem by Rafael Pastrana (https://github.com/arpastrana/compas_cem)  

the equations mentioned below are from the doctoral thesis Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling by Ohlbrock, P. O., ETH Zurich
the doctoral thesis can be downloaded in https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/478732

cem_mini is implemented by: Z. Guo

        - trail_paths should not result in any loop
        - trail_paths should contain all nodes of T
